                My name is Aur√©lien Luxey, I am 20 years old, and I am passionate about programming. This passion led me to pursue studies in computer science. Throughout my academic journey and the numerous projects I've participated in, as well as my professional experiences, I have developed a strong work ethic and essential teamwork skills.
                <br/><br/>
                During my studies, I also learned about team collaboration techniques, such as Agile methodologies, which are widely used in the professional world.
                <br/><br/>
                Today, I wish to continue my studies at an engineering school to enhance my theoretical and scientific knowledge and to train to become an engineer equipped with all the necessary skills. I aim to be more than just a developer and be capable of handling more complex tasks while still maintaining my developer skills.
